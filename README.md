How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?: It can be difficult to take the request/concerns of a user, and derive what needs to be done from it. This is where user stories can come into play. They request greater details along with the user's expectations. For what needs to be done to meet the requirements of the request.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?: An agile team will break up a project into smaller parts. Determining the order in which they need to be completed first. I like to focus on parts of a whole project, as opposed to the whole project itself. As it can be overwhelming to view the list of steps needed to complete a project. But less so if that list is only what is needed to be completed in one smaller part. That is to say, What I am most likely to incorporate in my own work is breaking a project down into its necessary parts.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?: I think the best way I could describe a good team member besides, getting work done well and on time. Is one who communicates. That is a member of the team who expresses concerns, helps other members with difficulties, and attends and participates in each meeting.
